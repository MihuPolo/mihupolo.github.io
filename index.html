												Unit 1 offers a comprehensive 
												introduction to foundational concepts in security and risk management. 
												It discusses various expert definitions of risk, underscoring its complexity 
												and context-dependent nature of risks. Key concepts include risk assessment, 
												qualification, and mitigation using both qualitative and quantitative methods. 
												The unit highlights the core principles of information security: confidentiality, 
												integrity, and availability.
												The unit explores common risk standards, threat modeling, and risk assessment processes. 
												It highlights the importance of integrating risk management systems with organizational 
												processes and the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle for continuous improvement. Practical 
												aspects of risk management are addressed through case scenarios, focusing on various 
												mitigation mechanisms, including physical, procedural, and technical controls.

											</p>

											<h4> Unit 2: Threats and Vulnerabilities </h4>	

											<p>Unit 2 dives into the relationship between threats and 
												vulnerabilities. According to NIST CSRC, a vulnerability is a technical weakness exploitable 
												by a threat source, while a threat is a potential adverse event impacting organizational 
												operations. The unit introduces the Threat Modelling Manifesto, emphasizing systematic 
												approaches, informed creativity, varied viewpoints, useful toolkits, and theory into practice. 
												It also discusses anti-patterns to avoid, such as over-focusing and the "hero" mentality.
												Key threat management models covered include STRIDE & DREAD, CVSS, OCTAVE, Attack Trees, 
												PASTA, MITRE ATT&CK, and OWASP. The unit underscores the importance of early threat modeling 
												in the development cycle and using varied tools and methodologies to effectively address 
												and mitigate security risks.

												recovery (DR), which are closely intertwined, with DR typically considered a subset of BC. 
												The importance of BC plans was highlighted during the 2020 pandemic, as businesses had to 
												adapt to government-mandated shutdowns by enabling remote work securely. This shift introduced 
												new security risks, necessitating updated policies and secure IT measures at home.
												BC, as defined in ISO 22301, ensures business operations continue during crises through risk 
												assessments, business impact analyses (BIA), and robust policies. Regular testing ensures 
												readiness. DR focuses on IT infrastructure availability during BC activation, driven by 
												Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) derived from BIA.
												Digitalization has intensified BC and DR needs, with cloud-based DR as a Service (DRaaS) 
												offering flexible and cost-effective solutions. Cloud-native applications align with modern 
												DR strategies, leveraging scalability and resilience. Architectural decisions like single vs. 
												multi-cloud providers and hybrid cloud models impact DR effectiveness and cost.
												Key considerations include data redundancy, availability zones, and platform resilience 
												when selecting cloud-based DR solutions. Technologies like Azure's Availability Sets and 
												Always On Availability Groups enhance database continuity. Understanding these elements 
												ensures robust BC and DR frameworks aligned with business needs and digital strategies.												
											</p>

											<h4> Unit 6: An Introduction to Risk Models and Approaches </h4>

											<p>
												Unit 6: An Introduction to Risk Models and Approaches: explores diverse risk models and 
												approaches crucial to modern security and risk management. Foundational methods like 
												Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian theory are highlighted for quantifying risks. 
												Specialized models such as Real Options Theory and the Options Pricing Theory (Black-Scholes 
												Model) are discussed, showcasing their applications from business decisions to environmental 
												management.
												Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is emphasized for its role in integrating risk across 
												organizational portfolios, promoting resilience and shareholder value. The evolution to 
												DevSecOps underscores the need for continuous security integration in software development,

										<h3>Assinment</h3>

											<p> 
												During this course our first assignment has been a team project, to create a Risk 
												Identification Report of Pampered Pets Business. Our team, consisting of Olimpia W., 
												Craig N., and myself, collaborated on a risk identification report for Pampered Pets 
												Business. We used WhatsApp, email, and university SharePoint for communication and 
												document sharing. Initially, we signed a team group contract and decided to assign 
												roles after some collaboration. Craig N., with his experience in writing cybersecurity 
												reports, eventually took the lead, guiding us through the report plan and task distribution.
											</p>

											<p>
												The assessor noted mentioned that the report demonstrates a thorough understanding of ISO 
												31000, STRIDE, and DREAD methodologies, emphasizing their relevance to Pampered Pets. 
												It identifies risks for both the current and potential digitalized states of the business. 
												The critical analysis effectively justifies the combination of STRIDE and DREAD methodologies 
												but could benefit from a detailed comparison of the current and post-digitalization risk 
												landscapes. To further enhance the report, we recommend explicitly discussing the suitability 
												of these methodologies and providing real-world examples. From my perspective, I enjoyed 
												working in a team. It has its charm, and you always know that someone will cover for you 
												in case of failure. The collaborative effort in preparing this report allowed us to leverage 
												diverse perspectives and expertise, leading to a more comprehensive analysis. Team discussions 
												often brought up points that I might have overlooked if working alone, and the mutual support 
												kept the project moving smoothly, even when individual challenges arose.
											</p>

											<p>
												The second assignment, I analysed the transition to digitalization by integration an 
												international supply chain alongside automated warehouses, the integration introduces 
												both quality and supply chain risks. Utilizing Monte Carlo Simulation, we identified 
												that the combined probability of quality risks is approximately 37.15%, while supply 
												chain risks stand at around 40.65%. To mitigate these risks, we recommend implementing 
												robust quality control measures, enhancing cybersecurity, and optimizing supply chain 
												processes. For disaster recovery, a high-availability architecture with cloud-based 
												replication, automated failover, and a multi-cloud strategy ensures minimal data loss 
												and continuous availability. By adopting these strategies, the company can safeguard 
												product quality and supply chain security amid digital transformation.

									<h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Debian OS Cybersecurity Workstation</h3>

									<p>
										Building a work machine for practicing cybersecurity skills on a Debian-based system is an excellent choice. 
										Debian is a stable, versatile, and widely-used Linux distribution that provides a strong foundation for 
										learning and deploying cybersecurity tools. Here’s how you can evolve this thought and build a comprehensive 
										cybersecurity practice environment.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Because Debian OS is free to use and it is quite difficult to find a PC with preinstalled Linux, 
										especially Debian OS, as a first move, I am going to describe step by step the process of installing the 
										system.
									</p>
									<h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Debian OS:</h3>
									<h4>1. Download Debian ISO:</h4>
									- 	Go to the Debian official website (Debian.org) and download the latest stable release ISO file.<br>
									- 	Choose the appropriate ISO file based on your system architecture (e.g., amd64 for 64-bit systems).<br>
									<h4>2.	Create a Bootable USB Drive:</h4>
									- 	As I have been doing that on Windows OS, I’ve always use Rufus to create a bootable USB drive.<br>
									- 	Download and open Rufus from rufus.ie.<br>
									-	Select your USB drive and the Debian ISO file.<br>
									- 	Click Start and wait for the process to complete.<br>
									<h4>3.	Boot from the USB Drive:</h4>
									- 	Insert the bootable USB drive into your PC.<br>
									- 	Restart your PC and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup by pressing a key (often F2, F12, DEL, or ESC – depends <br>
									of your computer brand) during startup.<br>
									-	Change the boot order to boot from the USB drive first.<br>
									-	Save the changes and exit the BIOS/UEFI setup.<br>
									<h4>4.	Start the Debian Installer:</h4>
									-	After booting from the USB drive, you’ll see the Debian Installer menu.<br>
									-	Select Graphical install for an easy-to-use graphical installation process.<br>
									<h4>5.	Select Language and Locale Settings:</h4>
									-	Choose your preferred language.<br>
									-	Select your location to set the time zone and system locale.<br>

									-	For wireless connections, select your network and enter the necessary credentials.<br>
									<h4>7.	Set Up Users and Passwords:</h4>
									-	Set a strong password for the root account (administrator privileges).<br>
									-	Create a new user account for everyday use. Enter the full name, username, and password for this account.<br>
									<h4>8.	Partition Disks:</h4>
									-	Choose a partitioning method. For beginners, the Guided - use entire disk option is recommended.<br>
									-	Select the disk to partition.<br>
									-	Choose how to partition the disk (all files in one partition is the simplest option).<br>
									-	Review and confirm the partitioning setup. Be aware that this will erase all data on the selected disk.<br>
									<h4>9.	Install the Base System, this process may take a few minutes.</h4>
									<h4>10.	Configure the Package Manager:</h4>
									-	Choose whether to scan another CD/DVD. If you downloaded additional packages, you can scan them now, <br>
										but typically you’ll select No.<br>
									-	Configure the package manager by selecting a network mirror close to your location for downloading <br>
										software packages.<br>
									-	Decide whether to participate in the package usage survey (optional).<br>
									<h4>11.	Install Software and Choose Desktop Environment:</h4>
									-	Select software to install. For a standard desktop environment, select Debian desktop environment and <br>
										your preferred desktop environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.).<br>
									-	You can also select additional utilities like SSH server or standard system utilities.<br>
									<h4>12.	Install the GRUB Bootloader:</h4>
									-	When prompted, choose to install the GRUB bootloader to the primary drive. This is necessary for booting <br>
										your system.<br>
									-	Confirm the device for boot loader installation (usually the main disk).<br>
									<h4>13.	Once the installation is complete, the installer will prompt you to remove the installation media and 
										restart the system.</h4>
									<h4>14.	First Boot and Post-Installation Steps:</h4>
									-	Remove the USB drive and reboot your PC.<br>
									-	Log in with the user account you created during the installation.<br>
									-	Update the system to ensure all packages are up to date.<br>
									<h4>15.	Update the system through terminal by writing: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y</h4> 
									<h4>Conclusion</h4>
