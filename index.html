											<p> 

												Unit 1 offers a comprehensive 
												introduction to foundational concepts in security and risk management. 
												It discusses various expert definitions of risk, underscoring its complexity 
												and context-dependent nature of risks. Key concepts include risk assessment, 
												qualification, and mitigation using both qualitative and quantitative methods. 
												The unit highlights the core principles of information security: confidentiality, 
												integrity, and availability.
												The unit explores common risk standards, threat modeling, and risk assessment processes. 
												It highlights the importance of integrating risk management systems with organizational 
												processes and the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle for continuous improvement. Practical 
												aspects of risk management are addressed through case scenarios, focusing on various 
												mitigation mechanisms, including physical, procedural, and technical controls.

											</p>

											<h4> Unit 2: Threats and Vulnerabilities </h4>	

											<p>Unit 2 dives into the relationship between threats and 
												vulnerabilities. According to NIST CSRC, a vulnerability is a technical weakness exploitable 
												by a threat source, while a threat is a potential adverse event impacting organizational 
												operations. The unit introduces the Threat Modelling Manifesto, emphasizing systematic 
												approaches, informed creativity, varied viewpoints, useful toolkits, and theory into practice. 
												It also discusses anti-patterns to avoid, such as over-focusing and the "hero" mentality.
												Key threat management models covered include STRIDE & DREAD, CVSS, OCTAVE, Attack Trees, 
												PASTA, MITRE ATT&CK, and OWASP. The unit underscores the importance of early threat modeling 
												in the development cycle and using varied tools and methodologies to effectively address 
												and mitigate security risks.

											</p>	

											<h4> Unit 3: Security and Risk Management Standards </h4>

												them with traditional qualitative approaches like risk matrices. It covers three main 
												techniques:

												Monte Carlo Simulation: This method uses random sampling to model complex systems' outcomes. 
												Key points include defining input domains, selecting probability distributions, and ensuring 
												accurate pseudo-random number generation. Principles stress distribution justification and 
												result analysis, while anti-patterns caution against tool sensitivity and mismatched 
												distributions.
												Bayes Theorem: A statistical method for updating beliefs based on new evidence, involving 
												calculating posterior probabilities from prior beliefs and likelihoods. Named after Rev. 
												Thomas Bayes, it emphasizes subjective probabilities and the impact of hypothesis/prior 
												selection. Anti-patterns highlight subjective interpretation and the influence of prior 
												information.
												Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA): Aids decision-making across multiple criteria, 
												categorized into choice, sorting, ranking, description, elimination, and design problems. 
												Techniques like TOPSIS, AHP, and ANP are chosen based on the decision type. Principles 
												focus on selecting suitable techniques and preparing data accurately, while anti-patterns 
												warn against incorrect technique selection and resulting errors in output.
												Unit 4 underscores the shift towards quantitative methods for precise risk assessment and 
												management, emphasizing their practical applications and considerations.
																								
											</p>

											<h4> Unit 5: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery </h4>

												recovery (DR), which are closely intertwined, with DR typically considered a subset of BC. 
												The importance of BC plans was highlighted during the 2020 pandemic, as businesses had to 
												adapt to government-mandated shutdowns by enabling remote work securely. This shift introduced 
												new security risks, necessitating updated policies and secure IT measures at home.
												BC, as defined in ISO 22301, ensures business operations continue during crises through risk 
												assessments, business impact analyses (BIA), and robust policies. Regular testing ensures 
												readiness. DR focuses on IT infrastructure availability during BC activation, driven by 
												Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) derived from BIA.
												Digitalization has intensified BC and DR needs, with cloud-based DR as a Service (DRaaS) 
												offering flexible and cost-effective solutions. Cloud-native applications align with modern 
												DR strategies, leveraging scalability and resilience. Architectural decisions like single vs. 
												multi-cloud providers and hybrid cloud models impact DR effectiveness and cost.
												Key considerations include data redundancy, availability zones, and platform resilience 
												when selecting cloud-based DR solutions. Technologies like Azure's Availability Sets and 
												Always On Availability Groups enhance database continuity. Understanding these elements 
												ensures robust BC and DR frameworks aligned with business needs and digital strategies.												
											</p>

											<h4> Unit 6: An Introduction to Risk Models and Approaches </h4>

											<p>
												Unit 6: An Introduction to Risk Models and Approaches: explores diverse risk models and 
												approaches crucial to modern security and risk management. Foundational methods like 
												Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian theory are highlighted for quantifying risks. 
												Specialized models such as Real Options Theory and the Options Pricing Theory (Black-Scholes 
												Model) are discussed, showcasing their applications from business decisions to environmental 
												management.
												Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is emphasized for its role in integrating risk across 
												organizational portfolios, promoting resilience and shareholder value. The evolution to 
												DevSecOps underscores the need for continuous security integration in software development, 
												addressing vulnerabilities early.

												challenges and advanced scientific approaches.																							
											</p>

										<h3>Assinment</h3>

											<p> 
												During this course our first assignment has been a team project, to create a Risk 
												Identification Report of Pampered Pets Business. Our team, consisting of Olimpia W., 
												Craig N., and myself, collaborated on a risk identification report for Pampered Pets 
												Business. We used WhatsApp, email, and university SharePoint for communication and 
												document sharing. Initially, we signed a team group contract and decided to assign 
												roles after some collaboration. Craig N., with his experience in writing cybersecurity 
												reports, eventually took the lead, guiding us through the report plan and task distribution.
											</p>

											<p>
												The assessor noted mentioned that the report demonstrates a thorough understanding of ISO 
												31000, STRIDE, and DREAD methodologies, emphasizing their relevance to Pampered Pets. 
												It identifies risks for both the current and potential digitalized states of the business. 
												The critical analysis effectively justifies the combination of STRIDE and DREAD methodologies 
												but could benefit from a detailed comparison of the current and post-digitalization risk 
												landscapes. To further enhance the report, we recommend explicitly discussing the suitability 
												of these methodologies and providing real-world examples. From my perspective, I enjoyed 
												working in a team. It has its charm, and you always know that someone will cover for you 
												in case of failure. The collaborative effort in preparing this report allowed us to leverage 
												diverse perspectives and expertise, leading to a more comprehensive analysis. Team discussions 
												often brought up points that I might have overlooked if working alone, and the mutual support 
												kept the project moving smoothly, even when individual challenges arose.
											</p>

											<p>
												The second assignment, I analysed the transition to digitalization by integration an 
												international supply chain alongside automated warehouses, the integration introduces 
												both quality and supply chain risks. Utilizing Monte Carlo Simulation, we identified 
												that the combined probability of quality risks is approximately 37.15%, while supply 
												chain risks stand at around 40.65%. To mitigate these risks, we recommend implementing 
												robust quality control measures, enhancing cybersecurity, and optimizing supply chain 
												processes. For disaster recovery, a high-availability architecture with cloud-based 
												replication, automated failover, and a multi-cloud strategy ensures minimal data loss 
												and continuous availability. By adopting these strategies, the company can safeguard 
												product quality and supply chain security amid digital transformation.

										<h3>Reflective Writing</h3>

											<p> 
												<h4>What? (Description)</h4>

												<p>
													As a general reflection, the study of security and risk management offers a comprehensive 
													foundation for understanding and addressing the multifaceted nature of risk. It underscores 
													the importance of integrating both qualitative and quantitative methods to assess, qualify, 
													and mitigate risk effectively. The core principles of information security—confidentiality, 
													integrity, and availability—serve as the cornerstone of robust risk management strategies.
													Effective risk management requires a thorough understanding of risk standards, threat 
													modeling, and risk assessment processes. Integrating risk management systems with 
													organizational processes and adhering to the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle ensures 
													continuous improvement and adaptability in the face of evolving threats. Practical 
													applications of risk management, including physical, procedural, and technical controls, 
													provide critical tools for mitigating risks and maintaining operational resilience.
													Ultimately, successful risk management involves not only identifying and addressing 
													potential threats and vulnerabilities but also implementing comprehensive strategies 
													to manage risks across various dimensions. By fostering a proactive approach and 
													leveraging a diverse set of tools and methodologies, organizations can enhance their 
													ability to safeguard assets, ensure business continuity, and achieve long-term security 
													and resilience.																							
												</p>

												<h4>So What? (Interpretation)</h4>

												<p>
													Applying the methodologies and concepts from the course units, our team was able to identify 
													risks for both the current and potential digitalized states of the business. The feedback 
													from the assessor noted that our report presented ISO 31000, STRIDE, and DREAD 
													methodologies, emphasizing their relevance for digitalizing Pampered Pets. However, 
													the feedback highlighted the need for a detailed comparison of the current and 
													post-digitalization risk landscapes and recommended explicitly discussing the suitability 
													of these methodologies while providing real-world examples.
													The most significant aspect of our collaboration was learning the importance of flexible 
													role assignment and leveraging individual strengths. Craig N.'s leadership was particularly 
													crucial, as his expertise in cybersecurity reports provided clear guidance and direction. 
													This situation demonstrated the value of adaptive team roles and the importance of 
													leveraging individual expertise for collective success. It was different from previous 
													group projects I've been part of, where roles were assigned arbitrarily from the start 
													without considering individual strengths and weaknesses. Our adaptive approach allowed 
													for a more dynamic and effective collaboration, resulting in a more robust final report. 
													The insights shared during our team discussions often brought attention to aspects I might 
													have missed on my own, and the collective support helped us navigate and overcome 
													individual challenges, ensuring steady progress throughout the project. Working together 
													on this report allowed us to combine different viewpoints and areas of expertise, creating 
													a well-rounded analysis.
													The most challenging yet insightful part of the theory was understanding how each 
													methodology—ISO 31000, STRIDE, and DREAD—contributed to a holistic risk management 
													strategy. ISO 31000 provided the framework for risk management, while STRIDE and DREAD 
													offered specific tools for identifying and assessing threats and vulnerabilities. This 
													reinforced previous learning about the importance of a structured approach to risk 
													management. However, it also introduced the challenge of integrating different 
													methodologies into a cohesive report. It confirmed the importance of thorough analysis 
													and critical thinking when selecting and combining methodologies. The feedback from the 
													assessor underscored the need for a detailed comparison of risk landscapes and the 
													inclusion of real-world examples, which I plan to incorporate in future projects.													
												</p>

												<h4>What Next? (Outcome)</h4>

												<p>
													From this experience, I learned the value of integrating theoretical knowledge with 
													practical applications. The course units provided a comprehensive foundation that 
													was instrumental in shaping our approach to the assignment. In future projects, I 
													will prioritize early identification of team members' skills and implement regular 
													check-ins to ensure alignment and address any issues promptly. Additionally, I plan 
													to study more real-world examples and case studies to deepen my understanding of risk 
													management methodologies and their application in various business contexts.
													In my professional life, I can apply these methodologies to develop comprehensive 
													risk management strategies tailored to specific business needs. Understanding how 
													to adapt and integrate different methodologies will be crucial for the successful 
													implementation of these strategies. This experience has underscored the importance 
													of continuous learning and adaptation in the field of risk management, ensuring that 
													I can effectively address and mitigate risks in any business context.
													Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience. It reinforced the 
													importance of theoretical knowledge while highlighting the need for practical 
													application. The team dynamics added an enjoyable dimension to the work, proving 
													that collaboration can significantly enhance both the process and the outcome.

										<h3>Reflective Activity: Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI</h3>

										<p>
											When ChatGPT went mainstream in late 2022, it felt like a turning point. Suddenly, AI wasn’t 
											just something researchers or niche industries were using — it was in people’s browsers, on 
											their phones, and in the news almost every day. As someone working in computing, I’ve been 
											both fascinated and unsettled by how quickly generative AI has become part of our lives.
										</p>

										<p>
											Reading Corrêa et al. (2023) reminded me that while the technology feels new, the ethical 
											conversations around AI have been going on for years. They reviewed 200 AI governance documents 
											from across the world and found a lot of common ground on principles like fairness, transparency, 
											and accountability. But they also found gaps — especially when it comes to global representation. 
											Many countries, particularly outside North America and Europe, don’t have much of a voice in 
											shaping these principles. That struck me because AI isn’t just affecting the countries that are 
											writing the rules; it’s affecting everyone.
										</p>

										<p>
											Deckard (2023) took the conversation in a more personal direction for me. He talks about AI ethics 
											as a career path and stresses that it’s not just about knowing the technology. It’s about being 
											able to navigate the legal, philosophical, and social sides of the conversation, and to explain 
											ethical concerns in a way that different audiences can actually understand. That’s something I’ve 
											noticed in my own work — the technical side is often the easiest to explain to colleagues, but 
											explaining the social impact to non-technical decision-makers takes a completely different approach, 
											touching on the deeper, almost metaphysical side of life and technology.
										</p>
											
										<p>
											One of the biggest challenges I see right now is that different stakeholders want different things 
											from AI governance. Governments want to protect national interests, companies want to protect profit 
											and market position, and advocacy groups are focused on human rights and social justice. This makes 
											it hard to get a single set of rules that everyone agrees on. The EU AI Act, for example, is one of 
											the more comprehensive attempts to regulate AI, but it’s very different from the lighter-touch, 
											industry-led approach in the US. If you deploy the same AI model in two different places, it could 
											be considered high-risk in one and almost unregulated in another (Wirtz et al., 2023).
										</p>
											
										<p>
											For me, that means we can’t just pick one model and hope it works everywhere. I think we need a 
											hybrid approach:
											<br>
											•	A shared international baseline of principles (like those already outlined by UNESCO and OECD), 
												so there’s some global consistency.
											<br>	
											•	Balanced global framework — Core AI ethics principles should be internationally standardised to 
												ensure consistency and speed up global regulation, while still allowing limited flexibility for 
												regions to adapt them to their own legal systems, cultural norms, and economic priorities.
											<br>
											•	Clear, mandatory impact assessments for high-risk AI systems, especially generative models that 
												can influence people’s opinions or behaviour.
											<br>
											And importantly, ethics can’t be a checkbox at the end. It has to be part of the AI lifecycle — from 
											design and data collection, through testing and deployment, to ongoing monitoring. That means bias 
											audits, privacy-by-design, clear documentation, and open channels for feedback from the public.
										</p>
											
										<p>
											I think Deckard’s point about education is also key. Too many people in tech (myself included at times) 
											learn ethics in theory but don’t get much practice applying it to real business decisions. If ethics was 
											embedded into professional training, with case studies and scenarios based on real dilemmas, we’d all be 
											better prepared to spot and challenge risky decisions before they cause harm.
										</p>

										<p>
											From a legal point of view, I can see how my proposed approach could help clarify liability when things 
											go wrong. If an AI system causes harm, we’d have clearer records of who assessed the risk and what steps 
											were taken to prevent it. That transparency could also build public trust — something that’s been eroded 
											in tech for years.
										</p>
											
										<p>
											Socially oriented governance could make a huge difference. If communities get to have a say in how AI is 
											used, they’re more likely to trust it. On the other hand, if regulation is too strict in one part of the 
											world and too loose in another, we risk creating new inequalities in who gets to benefit from AI.
										</p>
											
										<p>
											Professionally, I think this means computing roles are going to evolve significantly. Developers, data 
											scientists, and engineers will need to understand ethics, law, and social impact in a way that wasn’t 
											expected before. Professional bodies like the British Computer Society (BCS) — the Chartered Institute 
											for IT in the UK — and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) — a global organisation advancing 
											computing as a science and profession — will be central to this. Both have codes of conduct that stress 
											public interest, professional integrity, and ethical responsibility. They can help set professional 
											standards for AI ethics, create continuing professional development programmes, and provide guidance 
											for situations where a professional’s work might conflict with the public good. In practice, this could 
											mean offering members resources to challenge unethical directives, building communities of practice for 
											AI ethics, and influencing policy at both national and international levels.
										</p>
											
										<p>
											In the end, I came away from this reading convinced that generative AI is forcing us to confront some 
											uncomfortable questions much faster than we expected. Corrêa et al. (2023) show we already know what 
											many of the guiding principles should be. Deckard (2023) reminds us that it’s people — professionals 
											making daily decisions — who will determine whether those principles are actually followed. For me, 
											the lesson is clear: we can’t wait for perfect consensus before acting. We need to start embedding 
											ethics into practice now, while still working towards a more inclusive, enforceable, and adaptable 
											framework.

											<h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Debian OS Cybersecurity Workstation</h3>

											<p>
												Building a work machine for practicing cybersecurity skills on a Debian-based system is an excellent choice. 
												Debian is a stable, versatile, and widely-used Linux distribution that provides a strong foundation for 
												learning and deploying cybersecurity tools. Here’s how you can evolve this thought and build a comprehensive 
												cybersecurity practice environment.
											</p>
											
											<p>
												Because Debian OS is free to use and it is quite difficult to find a PC with preinstalled Linux, 
												especially Debian OS, as a first move, I am going to describe step by step the process of installing the 
												system.
											</p>
											<h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Debian OS:</h3>
											<h4>1. Download Debian ISO:</h4>
											- 	Go to the Debian official website (Debian.org) and download the latest stable release ISO file.<br>
											- 	Choose the appropriate ISO file based on your system architecture (e.g., amd64 for 64-bit systems).<br>
											<br>
											<h4>2.	Create a Bootable USB Drive:</h4>
											- 	As I have been doing that on Windows OS, I’ve always use Rufus to create a bootable USB drive.<br>
											- 	Download and open Rufus from rufus.ie.<br>
											-	Select your USB drive and the Debian ISO file.<br>
											- 	Click Start and wait for the process to complete.<br>
											<br>
											<h4>3.	Boot from the USB Drive:</h4>
											- 	Insert the bootable USB drive into your PC.<br>
											- 	Restart your PC and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup by pressing a key (often F2, F12, DEL, or ESC – depends
											of your computer brand) during startup.<br>
											-	Change the boot order to boot from the USB drive first.<br>
											-	Save the changes and exit the BIOS/UEFI setup.<br>
											<br>
											<h4>4.	Start the Debian Installer:</h4>
											-	After booting from the USB drive, you’ll see the Debian Installer menu.<br>
											-	Select Graphical install for an easy-to-use graphical installation process.<br>
											<br>
											<h4>5.	Select Language and Locale Settings:</h4>
											-	Choose your preferred language.<br>
											-	Select your location to set the time zone and system locale.<br>
											-	Configure your keyboard layout.<br>
											<br>
											<h4>6.	Configure the Network:</h4>
											-	If you have a wired connection, it should automatically detect and configure it.<br>
											-	For wireless connections, select your network and enter the necessary credentials.<br>
											<br>
											<h4>7.	Set Up Users and Passwords:</h4>
											-	Set a strong password for the root account (administrator privileges).<br>
											-	Create a new user account for everyday use. Enter the full name, username, and password for this account.<br>
											<br>
											<h4>8.	Partition Disks:</h4>
											-	Choose a partitioning method. For beginners, the Guided - use entire disk option is recommended.<br>
											-	Select the disk to partition.<br>
											-	Choose how to partition the disk (all files in one partition is the simplest option).<br>
											-	Review and confirm the partitioning setup. Be aware that this will erase all data on the selected disk.<br>
											<br>
											<h4>9.	Install the Base System, this process may take a few minutes.</h4>
										
											<h4>10.	Configure the Package Manager:</h4>
											-	Choose whether to scan another CD/DVD. If you downloaded additional packages, you can scan them now,
												but typically you’ll select No.<br>
											-	Configure the package manager by selecting a network mirror close to your location for downloading
												software packages.<br>
											-	Decide whether to participate in the package usage survey (optional).<br>
											<br>
											<h4>11.	Install Software and Choose Desktop Environment:</h4>
											-	Select software to install. For a standard desktop environment, select Debian desktop environment and
												your preferred desktop environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.).<br>
											-	You can also select additional utilities like SSH server or standard system utilities.<br>
											<br>
											<h4>12.	Install the GRUB Bootloader:</h4>
											-	When prompted, choose to install the GRUB bootloader to the primary drive. This is necessary for booting
												your system.<br>
											-	Confirm the device for boot loader installation (usually the main disk).<br>
											<br>
											<h4>13.	Once the installation is complete, the installer will prompt you to remove the installation media and 
												restart the system.</h4>
											<h4>14.	First Boot and Post-Installation Steps:</h4>
											-	Remove the USB drive and reboot your PC.<br>
											-	Log in with the user account you created during the installation.<br>
											-	Update the system to ensure all packages are up to date.<br>
											<br>
											<h4>15.	Update the system through terminal by writing: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y</h4> 
											<h4>Conclusion</h4>
											<p>
												By following these steps, you can successfully install Debian OS on your PC. This installation provides a solid 
												foundation for further configuring your machine for cybersecurity practice or any other use case you have in mind.
